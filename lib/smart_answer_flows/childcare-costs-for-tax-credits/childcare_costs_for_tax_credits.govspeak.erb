  Tax credits: work out your childcare costs

  Work out your eligible weekly childcare costs, when to report a change in costs

  You can calculate your childcare costs to give to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). They will tell you if you’re eligible to claim tax credits and how much you might get.

  If you already claim tax credits and your childcare costs have changed, [you must report the change](/changes-affect-tax-credits) to HMRC.

  ^Tax credits have been replaced by Universal Credit for most people. [Check if you can make a new claim for tax credits](/claim-tax-credits).^

  You must include the total childcare costs you pay. The number of children you have does not affect your eligibility for tax credits.

  You should not include:

  - childcare payments from your employer (in money or childcare vouchers)
  - childcare vouchers from your employer in return for a ‘salary sacrifice' (a reduction in your pay)
  - childcare payments or grants from a government scheme, for example to help you start work or because you're a student
  - childcare costs paid by an educational or local authority, for example free early learning or nursery education
